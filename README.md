# S30 Chassis Bushings

This is a repository of S30 chassis bushings. Reverse engineered from some PU bushings I bought, but that were much too hard.

To use these bushings, open FreeCAD and check the "Bodies", there are bushings and pins and bolts modelled. For most all of them you can cast the bushing, but you'll need to source the pins, sleeves, bolts, washers etc somewhere, as the bushings are physically quite different to the OEM ones and they require the extra hardware.

See the FreeCAD directory for source files, the STLs directory for the output files for 3d printing.
